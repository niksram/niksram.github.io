    title="Workload Trace Extrapolation for Future High Core-Count Processor Designs"
    subtitle="Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)"
    img="/AMD.png"
    desc="Designed an innovative method to synthetically extrapolate performance for high-thread count, data-sharing intensive applications from existing low-thread count instruction traces. This approach allowed for the reuse of existing traces, significantly reducing months of retracing and validation efforts."
